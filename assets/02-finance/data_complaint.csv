In the updated credit report I found that not only did they not resolve my complaint but they allowed   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   to update information on the account from charge-off with a balance of zero and no late payments to having no high credit limit, a balance of {$2200.00}, a charge off amount of {$2200.00}, re-age the date of last payment from  X/XXXX  to   XXXX  , and tack on   XXXX   reports of 90 days late to account that had a previous balance of {$0.00}.
I then disputed this new information with all   XXXX   credit agencies with the investigation results once again stating "" Information validated as accurate '' with out anything to support that statement.
I then proceeded to file a complaint with the BBB against  XXXX  about the matter. However, the BBB did nothing but open up a line of communication with  XXXX  No investigation supporting documents were furnished to support their findings, and they refused to correct the issue.
I then made direct contact with   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX  . Once I was able to finally get a hold of the right person, after first being sent to the collection department to try and strong arm me into paying on an account that is not mine, they simply gave me the number for  XXXX  and hung up.

"5/3/2017","Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","Credit reporting","Incorrect information on your report","Public record information inaccurate","On  XXXX   XXXX ,   XXXX  , after sending certified dispute letters, filing online and several calls, I spoke with a agent at   XXXX   (  XXXX  in Nevada  ) s he was very rude and did n't fully verify who I was even though there is a fraud alert and previous security freeze on my file. I asked to be transferred to a supervisor and got bounced around several times. I finally reached a supervisor in the fraud department (  XXXX  ) I informed her of the previous disputes out the Bankruptcy (  XXXX  ) as well as the accounts/public record and the inquires made without my consent. I was informed to file a police report. I had her on the phone while I was at the police station and the sergeant on duty told me that unless there is a current balance owed on the information that there was no need for a police report. When I returned to the call, she stated that if I faxed the information showing that,  XXXX  is reporting to them and the Bankruptcy court letter saying they have n't and do n't report to them, she would delete the unauthorized/non-contract holding accounts and inquiries seeing as no one has every provided me with the proof nor verification requested. I received a confirmation number of  XXXX  and was to ld it may t ake up to 30 day for the items to be deleted and me to receive an updated report showing so. On Saturday,  XXXX   XXXX , I received  XXXX  so called updated credit report dated  XXXX ,  XXXX ,   XXXX  . The first, (  XXXX  ) stating that the inquiries, I did n't consent to,   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   ; and  XXXX  from   XXXX   XXXX   are factual record of file access and they will not delete. Stated that I again need to contact each and every creditor. The second, (  XXXX  ) stated that the above inquiries as well as  XXXX   XXXX  ;  XXXX  fro  XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX    have been deleted from my credit file. The Bankruptcy listed above and accounts associated with it, updated report date of  XXXX   XXXX ,   XXXX  , verified through  XXXX  and will remain. The third only stated that inquiries are to remain for 2 years if with the fraud alert and security freeze. I filed a complaint on  XXXX ,  XXXX  with the cfpb and the bbb. Called on   XXXX   back on  XXXX   XXXX  (  XXXX   XXXX  an agent ( Smile ) answered and only asked me to verify the last  XXXX  of my social security number. I asked for the fraud department and was transferred to an agent  XXXX   XXXX   XXXX  who also only asked for me to verify my last  XXXX  when I refused and asked for her supervisor, she hung up. I returned the call and agent (  XXXX   XXXX  asked me to only spell my last name and told me she saw that I had a fraud alert and transferred me to agent  XXXX   XXXX   XXXX . I began telling him what happened and he placed me on hold for  two m inutes and came back and stated that the Bankruptcy court sent them information verifying the case listed above. When I again asked for proof of this verification as well as names of parties involved and dates and addresses and numbers, he then stated that they sent a runner to the courts.       Today    XXXX   XXXX ,   XXXX   at  XXXX    XXXX   CT, I called again to find out what was going on and why they have n't delete the information. The agent answering the call never verified who he was but proceeded to tell me he has me credit file pulled up, no verification of who I am, and placed me on hold to review. He came back online at  XXXX  and I immediately asked fo r a US agent  in the fraud department as he was reading my information he transferred me after holding  for 18 m inutes to agent (  XXXX   XXXX  she verified myself and we began the same conversation as with previous agents. She placed me on hold after I stated   XXXX     XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX  is repeatedly violating the Fair Credit Reporting Act by not sending me signed, written verification or validation of a Bankruptcy that showed up on my credit report, and constantly changing the dates that are reported on the credit report to prolong the length of time that it is reported on the report. I sent  XXXX  several letters requesting signed, written verification or validation. They just respond to me that the Bankruptcy and accounts are verified. There are numerous Inquiries that are on my credit report from companies that I have never heard of and they will not remove them. So I called  the US Bankr uptcy Courts and I was told a court clerk (  XXXX   XXXX   XXXX , that they do not, will not and never will report to the credit reporting agencies due to privacy laws.  XXXX  is saying that these debts are verified, Who is verifying them??? She transfer me to her supervisor. Supervisor  XXXX  answered call at  XXXX    XXXX    and placed me on a short hold to view my file. He verified me and told me that the Bankruptcy disputed on  XXXX   XXXX , is still processing because they did n't start the dispute until  XXXX   XXXX . I informed of the  XXXX  letters I received as well as what other agents stated. He told me that they did receive the files I sent even though I was told they never received anything from me. He proceeded to tell me that they verified it when the courts sent my file to them. I asked for this verification, he stated they were not allowed to disclose the information. I was in tears. I told him how long this process has been going on with every agent stating something different. It 's frustrating having to prove who I am and that I did n't do something or it is n't mine. He then stated, that what he said was n't true and that the courts do n't verify it but a  XXXX  party called  XXXX  did verify it when  XXXX  called them. Again I asked for name, number called and proof, because I sent them the consumer file I received from  XXXX  as well as them having the copies sent to them from the cfpb. He told me okay that is n't true either and that they sent a runner to the courts. I asked him was he kidding me, he lied to me and violated my rights and he said they ca n't do anything. I yet again asked to speak to someone else because he truly upset me. At  XXXX , A supervisor (  XXXX   XXXX  came on the line and told me that the previous agent filled him in on the situation. I asked him if the other agent told him of the lies he told me and he said no. He asked for a moment to read the notes and laughed. He apologized for the previous agent. I stated that the encounter alone, should have had the file deleted. He told me that the dispute from  XXXX   XXXX  is still pending because no one has responded nor verified the file. I asked him what they used to verify and he asked for my email address and stated that he would send me what they use and that he would take care of the removal. I asked how could he do that, when everyone else for months has said no and sent no proof. He told me it will be explained in the email and then gave me a confirmation number (  XXXX  ) to check back with.     This has been such a long and worn out process and still they are violating the FCRA as well as myself. I have sent certified mail to all  XXXX  credit bureaus asking them to please remove a bankruptcy that is not mine off of my credit report. I also asked them to send me proof of there verification papers and process so that I can assist in getting this information corrected to which they will not comply. I have reach out to the court system they have listed on my credit report and their response was that they do n't supply court case information to these companies. Once I got this response from the court I contacted them sending them certified mail and several faxes as well as online disputes, showing that and requested that they remove those accounts. They have yet to update my credit and have failed to remove this account. I have went to my local police to file a report about my identity theft like the credit bureaus have asked me to do and was denied due to no current balances on the accounts. I have done all that they have asked me to do as far as alerts and blocks, yet they wo n't remove the inaccurate information from my credit and wont comply with request for documentation on this case leading me to obtain legal counsel to file a lawsuit as soon as possible due to the fact that all  XXXX  have violated the FCRA Laws without total disregard to the damage it does to consumers.   XXXX    has just settled a class action lawsuit over this exact same issue, I will be a part of the suit also.","Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response","TRANSUNION INTERMEDIATE HOLDINGS, INC.","MO","631XX","Servicemember","Consent provided","Web","5/3/2017","Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",2473544

I have firstly contacted the courts and I actually went down to the court house and tried to verify it I was able to get any information one of my questions is simple is if I could not get any info ( "" HOW COULD TRANSUNION '' ). The XXXX COURT/XXXX CA DISTRICT sent me a letter from the County Clerk 's Office stating that at no given time do they report to any of the XXXX Credit Bureaus. I also put a security freeze on all of the major data mining companies like XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX and I have sent letters recently to XXXX XXXX. I will include them in the documentation portion. 

I have sent a formal notice to all XXXX Credit Bureaus and made XXXX CFPB complaints concerning their verification process of XXXX, Transunion and XXXX. I am a Deputy Sheriff for over 20 years experience I want to give you an example please indulge me If I make a traffic stop and the dispatcher says that person has a bench warrant but for me I have to verify the warrant The dispatcher just looking at the screen and see the information it is not verified. She has to pull the actual warrant info with the signature of the judge. Then I can make the arrest. 

The XXXX bureaus use these data mining companies and using info on a screen that they can not be verified thru the courts the letter states that and I have put security freezes on all other entities and CB 's sometime do not give you the needed info required from the FCRA on who verified, name, phone number, name of company etc. 

I asked Transunion verification made pursuant to Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. Please note that I am requesting "" Verification '' that is competent evidence bearing my signature showing that I have or ever had a Bankruptcy. An Employee looking at their computer screen seeing my name listed in their database is "" NOT ' verification or validation which is two different things of any Bankruptcy. Verfication accordance to XXXX XXXX is ... ... .. averment that the party pleading is ready to establish the truth of what he has set forth.

I inquired to know this information as the public record continues coming back as my public record. In addition to my several written request, I have spoken with various customer service representatives an d 3 of the 5 informed me that the request/dispute is sent as a message to the courthouse and once the court verifies it, the information is sent back to the credit bureau. After seeking legal consultation, I was advised to contact the court directly to inquire on their protocol and procedures, for submitting public records to various credit bureaus. After I contacted the court, the clerk advised me that they do not disclose, release or verify any information with the credit bureaus or any 3rd parties. At the point, I c ontacted TransUnion once again and spoke with another representative who at this time advised me the information is verified by a 'runner ' who goes to the court house. I asked what information does the 'runner ' give to the courthouse, and how and what kind of physical information does the runner give back to the credit bureau. At this time, the representative was unable to answer my question so I requested to speak with a supervisor. The supervisor advised me due to this being an ongoing re-investigation that there is no 'runner ' involved. The supervisor told me that they use a form which is sent to the courthouse. I asked what form and exactly where the form was sent. I asked if she could provide me with a copy of this form.

"5/5/2017","Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","Credit reporting","Problem with a credit reporting company's investigation into an existing problem","Their investigation did not fix an error on your report","I have been a victim of extreme theft identity that has spanned over a 3 year period. Upon several denials for credit early last year, I pulled my credit and noticed a tremendous amount of accounts, inquiries, and discrepancies on my report from all  XXXX  credit bureaus. I then phone contacted each creditor and informed them that I had been a victim of identity theft and asked them to provide original documents showing my hand written or electronic signature signing for the debts/ accounts that were in dispute. I was told that my accounts had been sold to different collection agencies in which they could not or failed to provide accurate account numbers, names/addresses and telephone numbers for them leading to a dead end. After going around in circles, dead ends, and disconnected phone lines I then notified the  XXXX  credit bureaus where an investigation was done between  XXXX  and   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX  . I received notification within 5 days that information was verified and accurate with TransUnion and  XX/XX/XXXX .   XXXX    on the other hand, took the time to properly investigate with creditors. In turn, most inquiries and accounts that were fraudulent were removed and fraud alert placed on report. I proceeded to send a second certified letter to all  XXXX  credit bureaus in    XXXX   XXXX    after further researching and gaining knowledge of the FCRA guidelines. At that time, I noticed that  XXXX  has reinserted  XXXX  accounts back on my account that was previously disputed and deleted twice without notifying me within 5 days of insertion. After speaking to them about this and their violation of the FCRA, they did not remove but stated that it had to be re-disputed for a third time? According to the FCRA sectio n 611 thi s is in direct violation for not notifying me that it was reinserted and is suppose to be deleted permanently. After that, I sent in a police report and itemized verified/certified letter with each negative account and inquiry to each bureau and then proceeded to contact each bureau around    XXXX   XXXX    after receipt of documents to make sure that they received the items and to comply. According to the FCRA, it states that if I am a victim of identity theft, I have the right to have any incorrect and fraudulent information removed and blocked so that it is not reported again on a consumers report. I stated this to each bureau and the response I got from each was that they have their own guidelines and they ca n't just remove the information and/or block it without doing a FOURTH investigation and contacting the creditors again. They also stated that they do not require the creditors to provide valid details such as original signatures, entire account numbers, etc in order for them to continue to report an account as accurate. This is also in direct violation of the FCRA due to the fact that creditors have to provide valid information such as signatures, dates open, accurate account numbers in order for it to be considered valid. Otherwise, it has to be deleted from report. None of this was provided to me by neither the creditors or credit bureaus. After speaking to a supervisor at  XXXX  name  XXXX  today I am also having an issue with them deleting the name ending in  XXXX  as well as multiple addresses on file that were all used in the identity theft cases to open accounts upon my several wishes to do so. I have also expressed an issue with me calling in on   XXXX   XXXX    to file another dispute for the same accounts that went into an investigation. I was told that I could not file another dispute with  XXXX  for the same thing twice? That is beyond inaccurate. The representative proceeded to file a dispute anyway, but on the  XXXX  of   XXXX   I received my   XXXX   report dated   XXXX   XXXX   that the investigation was complete and all accounts had been verified as being accurate. How was it possible to file and be completed the same exact day I called in? I have  XXXX  accounts in dispute, and there is no way that information from all creditors were in fact reported back to bureau in less than  a 24  hour period. I spoke to the supervisor about this and told her that I do not have faith that  XXXX  is properly conducting investigations because of this. She apologized and claimed she did not even see where I even called in on the  XXXX  to initiate another dispute. Strange. After speaking with TransUnion today about my police report and investigation process and the supervisor name  XXXX   XXXX  informed me that they received my report but that it was either invalid ( as if I stole a report and wrote it myself  )  or it did not meet the criteria for TransUnion?? I then proceeded to ask her what the criteria was and that she was the one I had spoken to previously that told me to get the police report. She told me that they mailed me a letter on  XXXX   XXXX  explaining that they could not use the police report but that they would add it to my file to send to creditors. I kept asking what criteria she was referring to so that I can know and be in compliance of what needed to be done and she told me that she could not disclose that to me. This whole process has become so frustrating and I feel like I am fighting with a bear and losing. I do n't know what else to do besides file a lawsuit against all   XXXX    bureaus as I have caught them in violation of the FCRA guidelines several times and they still will not comply. This strain on my credit and identity theft has caused a financial and emotional hardship for me and my family at least for the past 3 years when it was first identified that I had become a victim and I just want this nightmare to be over.","Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response","TRANSUNION INTERMEDIATE HOLDINGS, INC.","CA","900XX","Servicemember","Consent provided","Web","5/5/2017","Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",2476188

The fact that I received a response 4 days after the recipients received my certified letter, one can assume that there was no investigation into the matter.

"5/5/2017","Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","Credit reporting","Incorrect information on your report","Information belongs to someone else","XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   : My mother, the sole debtor, passed away.       XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   : I phoned her creditors to notify them of her death. My initial contact with   XXXX   XXXX   was with  XXXX , who then forwarded the call to  XXXX   XXXX . I was instructed by  XXXX   XXXX  to send a copy of my mothers death certificate.       XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   : I mailed a letter with the death certificate enclosed to the  XXXX , NY address instructed by  XXXX   XXXX . Included in the letter was my declaration that my mother did not leave a  Will,  had no assets solely in her name, and an  Estate  would not be opened. I also stated she did not have a co-signer, and by law, her survivors, including myself, are not legally obligated to pay her debt.       XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   :   XXXX   XXXX   addressed a letter to my mother, requesting payment. Similar notices had been received from other creditors, which I was told to ignore. I assumed, as with other creditors, their records had not been updated. Therefore, I ignored the letter.     Note : According to the last statement received, the balance was {$2500.00}. The closing date was   XXXX  ,  one we ek prior to my mothers death. However, the amount shown on the letter dated   XXXX   XXXX   was {$3900.00}, a difference of {$1400.00}. My mother did not leave the house during her final week alive. I find such a substantial increase very suspect. However, since the debt would  be discharged,  I didnt consider it an issue worth fighting.     Unknown Date in   XXXX   XXXX   : Someone in the employ of   XXXX   XXXX  , submitted an adverse credit report, in the form of a credit card charge-off, in my name. I have no idea how they obtained my SS #. I have never applied for credit with their company. Nor have I received notification of credit established with their company, a statement of charges, or demand for payment.     Their negative action was done without my knowledge, and without notification of their intent to damage my credit. Moreover, they failed to make even  one de mand for payment, from myself, or any of my mothers survivors. All statements and letters requesting payment were addressed exclusively to my mother.     In my letter dated   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX  , I explicitly stated the debt would not be paid by myself or other survivors. Having also handled my late fathers affairs following his death, I am well-aware of the unscrupulous tactics used by some companies to try to intimidate survivors to pay the debts of their loved ones. For this reason, I felt it was necessary to inform her creditors that payment would not be made. Regardless, having no arrangement between   XXXX   XXXX   and myself, their adverse actions against my credit is a flagrant violation of  Federal law.        XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   :   XXXX   XXXX   addressed a letter to the  Estate  of,  c/o Next of Kin.  The letter was a demand for payment for the balance on the account ; which, as previously stated, was substantially higher than the balance on the last statement.     A  Notarized Proof of Claim,  filed on the same date, was also enclosed. Both the letter and Notarized Proof of Claim were signed by   XXXX   XXXX  , a   XXXX   XXXX    representative.       XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   : While finalizing all pending issues related to my mothers affairs, I contacted   XXXX   XXXX   by phone to inquire about the letter and Notarized Proof of Claim dated   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX  . I reiterated an  Estate would  not be opened.     I was instructed by   XXXX   XXXX   to disregard the letter and  Notarized Proof of Claim.   He stated they were simply a legal formality, and the debt would be e discharged. I   considered it rather strange for a company to have a document notarized for filing with the court against a non-ex istent Estate, simpl y as a legal formality. However, in good faith, I accepted his word.     I assume, in his position, he was privy to the fact that the company had already submitted a charge-off damaging my credit. However, he did not mention the adverse action.     It is absolutely mind-boggling that a company would charge-off an account in   XXXX  . Then, in   XXXX  , issue a letter demanding payment, accompanied by a  Notarized Proof of Claim filed against a non-existent Estate. However, that is precisely what transpired. Unfortunately, I was oblivious to their negative cr edit report until the latter part of   XXXX   XXXX  .       XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   : During a financial transaction requiring a review of my credit history, I discovered the erroneous adverse action by   XXXX   XXXX  . I immediately contacted   XXXX   XXXX  . I spoke with  XXXX , explaining the error and requesting to have the adverse info removed from my credit report.     After a review of my mothers account, he stated there was no record of my name. He then asked if he could check using my SS #, which I provided. He returned to the phone and stated again that my name was not in their system.     I then asked how it is possible for   XXXX   XXXX   to submit adverse info to damage my credit, if there is no record of my name in their system. He said he had no explanation. I was then instructed to submit a request in writing, via fax, to the  Correspondence Department  at   XXXX   XXXX  . He then gave me the fax number, which I repeated to him for verification.     I then decided to contact    XXXX   XXXX   , given that he was the individual who had filed the  Notarized Proof of Claim  against my mothers non-existent  Estate.      I was flippantly informed by   XXXX   XXXX   that there was nothing he could do to resolve the matter. After a rather unpleasant exchange, he stated I must send a letter to the  Correspondence D epartment, as they alone could handle the issue.       XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   : I faxed and mailed a letter explaining the error, demanding resolution. I included copies of all pertinent correspondence. I also explained the urgency of having this issue resolved, and advised if the problem was not handled expeditiously, I would file a formal complaint with the FTC and MD and PA States Attorneys.     However, after forwarding the letter to a law firm friend, I was advised if this situation is not resolved, I should first file a complaint with your organization.       XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   : I contacted   XXXX   XXXX   to inquire about the status of my request, and asked to speak with the  manager of the Correspondence Dep artment. I was then asked the nature of the call, which I explained. I was then asked to provide my mothers full name, address, phone number, date of birth, last  four  digits of her SS #, and my name. I provided all requested info.     I was then placed on hold for a rather lengthy period. I assume the wait was due to a discussion of my case between the individual I spoke with and the  Correspondence Dept . So, I patiently waited.     The female I spoke with did not return. Rather, the next person on the phone said, Hello, I am  XXXX . How  may I assist y ou? I requested to speak with the  manager of  the  Correspondence Dept. He  said, Youll have to contact them in writing. I then explained that I had already sent a letter and other documents to their department, and would like to know the status of my request.     I was then informed that I could not speak with the  XXXX  Department, they only respond to written correspondence. I again tried to explain my dilemma, and that I had in fact contacted them in writing. He again refused to forward the call.     I then said,  XXXX , what is your last name? He arrogantly replied, Im not giving you my last name. I then asked if   XXXX   XXXX   is the  CFO . He stated he is. Angrily, I then said, Thank you,  XXXX .

On   XXXX  , I pull my yearly credit report to reveal that the inquiries were put back on to my credit report. I was never made aware of the reinsertion of these inquiries and have went to great measures trying to get Transunion to remove them as a result of failing to notify me of the reinsertion. I understand that inquiries made after the date of  XXXX   XXXX  was not affected by the glitch, however the  XXXX  inquiries that I called in reference to were all in the year of  XXXX  and was a part of the glitch. I first spoke to   XXXX   on   XX/XX/XXXX   around  XXXX  EST who claimed to be a supervisor in the special handeling department and told me that I was not affected by the glitch. She basically called me a liar and was unable to pull a previous years credit report to verify my claim. Instead she asked me to mail them proof. My question was, what list are the using to verify that I WAS N'T affected if they ca n't pull a previous years credit report to compare inquiries? After not getting anywhere I called back on  XXXX / XXXX / XXXX  at  XXXX  to speak with a   XXXX    with  a heavy  XXXX  accent who stated he was out of t he USA , ho wever I was not able to understand him so again I asked to be transferred to a  US special ha ndling agent. Within seconds, another claimed to be supervisor named  XXXX , who also had a thick   XXXX   XXXX   accent, came on the line and denied that there was ever any kind of glitch which for sure is not true at all because indeed there was one. I 'm pretty sure  XXXX  never honored my request to be transferred to a US special handling supervisor because the normal pause and playing of music never happened.  XXXX  just picked up the phone almost simultaneously as he placed the call on hold. After  XXXX  told me there was no glitch I decided to end the call because again,  XXXX ,  XXXX , and  XXXX  are all at this point calling me a liar and saying that my inquiries were not removed, when in fact every one of them on my report were gone. Not once, but twice. I called back a third time on   XX/XX/XXXX   and talked to a lady named  XXXX , who says she was from the United States Special Handling Department. I got the same answer as I got from  XXXX  as in, after researching my name was showing that it was n't affected. At this point I 'm sure they are all typing notes about my concern about this issue and inserting their own opinion, however, they are all immediately so defensive that they are really not taking the time to understand the real problem at hand which is the removal and reinserting of credit inquiries without giving me any proper notice in which I am legally entitled to.  XXXX  said that if I did n't get a letter that they were deleted then I was n't affected. The problem is, I did n't get a letter saying that I was affected, nor that they were reinserting them, both of which I should have been notified of. Lastly I talked to  XXXX  who states she is a  US  special handling agent. Unlike the others who pretend to search a database and placed me on holds for long periods of time, she just immediately told me that my name was not on the list of affected people. Not only was I affected by this removal and reinsertion of inquiries without being informed,  XXXX  never even attempted to research my account at all. The fact remains that there was a glitch in which me and everyone in the world that has a credit report through Transunion was affected, so for them to repeatedly tell me that what I 'm saying is not true is degrading and unjustifiable. I am not asking for inquiries after that date of  XXXX   XXXX  to be removed, I am asking for the inquiries that actually disappeared to be removed which are all  XXXX  inquiries from  XXXX .

Fraud is the intentional use of deceit, a trick or some dishonest means to deprive another of his or her or its money, property or a legal right. A party who has lost something due to fraud is entitled to file a lawsuit for damages against the party acting fraudulently, and the damages may include punitive damages as a punishment or public example due to the malicious nature of the fraud. Quite often there are several persons involved in a scheme to commit fraud and each and all may be liable for the total damages. Inherent in fraud is an unjust advantage over another which injures that person or entity. It includes failing to point out a known mistake in a contract. There is a known mistake in a contract that was never pointed out to me by my broker. It also includes failing to not reveal a fact which he or she has a duty to communicate, such as not delivering promised amenities. My broker promised amenities including a tanning bed and garages as originally understood. The amenities of a tanning bed and garages were not delivered to me as promised. Constructive fraud can be proved by a showing of breach of legal duty such as lying about advertising amenities that were not delivered. Constructive fraud can be proved by a showing of breach of legal duty without direct proof of fraud or fraudulent intent. Extrinsic fraud occurs when deceit is employed to keep someone from exercising a right, such as a fair trial, by hiding evidence or misleading the opposing party in a lawsuit.","Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response","TRANSUNION INTERMEDIATE HOLDINGS, INC.","NC","280XX","Older American","Consent provided","Web","4/28/2016","Closed with explanation","Yes","Yes",1898441

I also asked you to give me the name of the person in your company who verified the accuracy of these accounts but you ignored this request as well which is another violati on of Federal Law a nd evidence of your willful disregard of the law.

The facts are : On X/XX/2017, I applied for a lease at XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX, Washington. I gave them check number XXXX in the amount of {$190.00}. That same day, they were also given check number XXXX in the amount of {$40.00}, to replace check number XXXX, per our agreement. The agreement had been : I gave the initial check ( number XXXX ) for {$190.00}, and if I was not approved for the lease, my check would be returned to me and I would give them a new check in the amount of {$40.00}, to cover the application fee, and that my previous check would be returned to me. Then later that same day, I was contacted by the female employee at XXXX XXXX XXXX, and informed that I had not been approved for the lease. I informed the employee that I would be up before days end to give her a new check, in the amount of {$40.00}, and retrieve my other check, per our spoken agreement earlier that day. The employee informed me that she could just cash the check I had already given her, and that I would eventually be reimbursed by check, for the difference of {$150.00} that I 'd be owed, however I politely informed her that that was not acceptable to me and that per our previous agreement, I would return within a few hours, before end of business day to give her a new check and take back the previous check. The employee stated that she would prefer to just cash the first check I had given her and reimburse me the difference some weeks later, however I was again, very clear in informing her that She did not have my permission to do so, and that I would be there by close of business to collect check number XXXX that I had previously given her, and would give her a new check, check number XXXX in the amount of {$40.00} to cover only the monies owed. I tried to arrange a mutually satisfactory time to meet with her and do the check exchange,  however the employee disconnected the phone on me rather than answer. Later that same day, I returned to XXXX XXXX but the office was locked, even though it was still business hours. I left check number XXXX in the amount of {$40.00} in the apartment dropbox, including a note asking the employee to please mail me back check XXXX, in the amount of {$190.00}. I called the apartment again later that same day, and spoke to the same employee to verify she had received my check and my note. Unfortunately, she was argumentative. She responded to my questions, by stating that she was busy and had already cashed the first check that I had given her, in complete disregard of our agreement.
She would not acknowledge or verify the second check I had left for her in the amount of {$40.00}. She again claimed the first check had already been cashed. I asked to speak to a manager, or someone who could take responsibility but the call was then disconnected. Naturally I was suspicious at this point, and rather than go back up to the apartment complex and deal with the employee who seemed to lack integrity I called my bank and explain the situation to them. They advised that they would put a stop payment on the first check, check XXXX, however The bank stated that if it had already been cashed, or even been deposited online already, as the employee stated ( which was her apparent reason for refusing to return my check to me XXXX then the stop payment would not be able to go through. The stop payment could only go through if the first check had not been deposited yet, which would obviously contradict what I was told by the employee, and would mean the employee was still in possession of both checks, and had been lying to me when she stated she could not return my check because it had already been cashed. The fact that a stop payment ever went through on check number XXXX, means the employee at XXXX XXXX had not cashed the check already and she had lied and intentionally deceived me, and has now committed slander and libel on top of that.","Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response","TRANSUNION INTERMEDIATE HOLDINGS, INC.","WA","993XX","Servicemember","Consent provided","Web","5/24/2017","Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",2490154

Their practices seem to be highly unethical. For example, if the account is used for a restaurant or hotel or other service that submits for pre-authorization, XXXX puts through the final charge and also holds the original pre-authorization amount for 10 days. Effectively this is a duplicate charge to the account that renders what should be available funds as unavailable. I addition, XXXX does not accurately report account balances to the credit bureaus. I have both a XXXX & XXXX XXXX credit card that are handled by XXXX. I recently paid down my outstanding balances to improve my credit score as I intended to purchase a car that required a loan. In stead of my credit score improving, it actually decreased as XXXX failed to report the payments made to reduce my balance significantly and has n't done so to date. I also paid off the entire balance for the XXXX account only to be charged an additional {$15.00} interest charge after the fact. How is this legal? Following is their response to my quesry about the charge- Thank you for your recent inquiry to our Customer Care Department . XXXX XXXX XXXX issues your account and responds to all credit related inquiries. This card is issued by XXXX XXXX XXXX pursuant to a license by XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX is a registered trademark of XXXX XXXX XXXX. I apologize for any confusion this has caused. On your previous statement, you were informed of an update to your Credit Card Agreement for your account. This notification was to inform you that beginning on your next statement, purchases made outside a Grace Period would be assessed trailing interest resulting in a finance charge after the balance is paid in full. A Grace Period is a period in time in which credit extended can be repaid without a finance charge being assessed. Interest is charged from the transaction date until the balance is paid in full. Since interest is calculating until the date the payment is received, you will receive a statement for the interest charged in the previous billing cycle. If you pay the trailing interest finance charge statement by the due date, you will not be assessed finance charges during that bill cycle the following month as long as no additional purchases are made.

I do n't have any accouts with any of the creditors so how is that possible and I did not give consent to run my credit. I have placed a fraud alert on my file and TransUnion are still allowing creditors to pull my file without my permission. None of the inquiries are associated with an account or any firm offer for credit, insurance, court order, or employment. The dispute results are always "" inquiries are factual and to contact the creditor '' I have reached out to the majority of the creditors listed and explained my situation and all have advised me that they will send TransUnion, XXXX, and XXXX the information needed to remove from my file. I have received inquirie removal letters from most of them already and I have proof of documentation stating that they will remove the inquirie. How is TransUnion able to send me documents stating that they will not remove because inquires are factual when I have actual letters from the creditors and within the body of these letters it clearly states that they will send the Credit Agencies the proper documents to remove from my file. TrabsUnion is not investigating any of the information. Please have this information removed from my Credit Report.Again, I have no knowledge of these inquiries these are inquiries I have no account. I did not give anyone permission to run my Credit.

( 2 ) They received my information when the acquired XXXX XXXX service in XXXX XXXX, CA. ( 3 ) My account with XXXX was closed at the time XXXX acquired the account with a XXXX balance. Despite acknowledging these three items the woman said she could only route me to their billing department to set up a payment plan. I explained how illogical it was to make payments on a non-existent debt. She said she could n't correct the records, I could just set up a payment plan. Eventually she said she 'd transfer the call to someone who could help me but all she did was route me to the people who set up payment plans. I told them I did n't owe the debt and they re-routed back to the same number where I had just spent over an hour on hold waiting to be told nothing could be done. Rather than waste another hour talking to someone that I knew was n't going to resolve the issue, and having seen online the fact that numerous people in XXXX XXXX were complaining about XXXX being unresponsive to all complaints, I sent a check ( # XXXX ) to XXXX for {$720.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. I referenced on the face of the check that I did not owe the debt and that it was, in fact, a fake debt ( I have a copy of it ). As of the last time I checked, XXXX did not cash that check. I then received a notice from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX dated XX/XX/XXXX saying they were trying to collect the non-existent {$720.00} debt. I called XXXX again and spent another hour during which another XXXX employee re-confirmed the same three facts mentioned above. Despite recognizing that I obviously did not owe XXXX any money and that my old ( closed ) XXXX account also had a XXXX balance when it was acquired by XXXX, she asked me to send all of my records of payments to XXXX in order to confirm that XXXX 's own records were accurate that I did not owe XXXX {$720.00}. I explained that any such attempt was much more time-consuming than {$720.00} was worth even if I still had such records which I was certain I did not have. A short time later she hung up or we were disconnected as she tried to transfer my call. In an effort to save my credit rating from this utterly false debt claim, I did as directed in the letter and sent another check for {$720.00} directly to XXXX ( but this time without noting on the face of the check that I did n't owe it ). XXXX cashed that check on XX/XX/XXXX. Despite paying the amount that I never owed, XXXX reported this fake debt as a charge off and my credit rating dropped from well over XXXX to less than XXXX.

Instead, the credit reporting agencies used quick reference codes as short as 2 characters to ( respond in about 4 seconds ) say that data on my customer/consumer information is being reported correctly. I had a repossession that I settled, 2 collections accounts I paid off, a credit card that I settled, a bankruptcy application that was on their but not completed.

As for my own personal Credit score. It appears that all three of the Credit Reporting Agencies are creating a false and very Low Unrealistic Credit Score. This has become very obvious based on my credit history since Bankruptcy. I believe they are doing this so that Lenders will not offer me the best credit available and instead these Bureaus are creating the scenario that forces me to pay higher interest rates and fees. Most importantly XXXX Credit Report is what Credit Check Score is basing my Credit Score from. So I ask you again how can I improve my credit score to over XXXX? It is obvious that I pay all of my payments on time, keep all credit cards balance paid off every month and have done everything suggested by Credit Score as well as XXXX. I am frustrated by the constant interference by the Credit Reporting Agencies and their low intentional Credit Scoring that is designed to force me the Consumer from obtaining the best credit available.

As you thoroughly review the information that I provide it will be clear that XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX is knowingly, purposefully and willfully reporting inaccurate information. 2. Included in this packet is the original assumption documents which show the terms of the assumption. In those documents XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX & XXXX XXXX agreed to the terms which clearly stated that the account would be considered current so long as kept all payments current as outlined in the assumption documents. Additionally, within this packet you will see there is no agreement or mention of negative credit reporting for this assumption a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX has repeatedly informed me there is. When I inquired as to what legal document gives them the right to report an account as delinquent when its not they repeatedly couldnt produce any documentation with my signature agreeing to such egregious terms. 3. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX have pulled every dirty trick in the book to foreclose on my mothers home. The only problem is they couldnt due to my mother being allowed to collateralize my bother ( XXXX XXXX ) and my land without out written consent.

As an XXXX XXXX service member, Ive worked very hard to establish and maintain good credit but all of that stands to be wiped out if XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX isnt stopped from posting fraudulent account status to my credit report. 4.

As I was now retired on a fixed income at that time, the new higher payments were a struggle to make. I applied to XXXX for a loan modification.

He stated that any unpaid balance would be assimilated in to the modified loan. So I stopped making those payments. <P/>The modification was approved and I entered the 3 month trial payment period.

Through Direct Dispute, TransUnion acknowledged that the dispute was being investigated and that they normally respond within 30 Days. On XXXX XXXX 2017, I sent a certified mail letter to TransUnion at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, CA XXXX. This mail was returned to sender. I then made attempts to call TransUnion on the telephone at XXXX. I spoke with two people. The first lady told me the dispute was completed. When I told her that I had received no such confirmation, and that the current status in Direct Dispute on XXXX XXXX shows the status as currently under investigation, she told me they had emailed me the result. I asked her which email and she told me, the one on file used to open the dispute. However, as described herein, the dispute was opened on XXXX XXXX, and I have screenshots. I told her this many times, yet she kept telling me the dispute was closed. Eventually she changed her story and said the results were mailed to me, however I have seen no mail and the Direct Dispute center shows that the dispute is still under investigation. After trying to clarify the situation, and with proof that the Direct Dispute center shows an open dispute, the lady kept talking in circles about how the dispute was closed yet would not offer any proof or method for me to confirm this. At this point I asked for the manager. The manager again asked for my social security number, and verified my identity. I explained the previous information to him again, and that the status of the dispute shows currently under investigation. He again told me that they had emailed the information. Later he said it was mailed. Neither of them provided me any concrete evidence or method to verify the dispute was closed, and furthermore, the official Direct Dispute center which is a partnership between XXXX XXXX and TransUnion, shows that the dispute is still currently open 55 days after the initial dispute was confirmed. I would like to resolve this matter in as timely a manner as possible because according to Direct Dispute timeline they are in violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act. Direct Dispute is an official partnership between both TransUnion and XXXX XXXX, so I see no reason for the story the two TransUnion representatives provided me with. I have use Direct Dispute prior and the results are always communicated through Direct Dispute, so the story I got from both TransUnion representatives does not make sense. I believe this warrants a thorough investigation of TransUnion business practices and how they are attempting to take advantage of consumers by lying about results of disputes.

Which is untrue. They finally took payment from XXXX after I disputed the balance on my credit report. They now, over 3 years later refuse to take payment from my GAP insurance and still report my car as repossessed. If my car is repossessed and not totaled out, I demand to see the auction report. They are required to auction a repossessed car and provide me the amount left on the loan. But they can not do that because the car was totaled and therefore not repossessed. XXXX needs to remove the repossession off my credit profile before I sue them in civil court. I suggest if XXXX offers any consumer a loan, they walk away from the dealership.

I challenged the accuracy, compliance and reportability of this listing. I requested TransUnion to please validate this information with New Jersey Federal Bankruptcy Court- XXXX and provide me with copies of any documentation associated with this account, bearing my signature. In the absence of any such documentation bearing my signature, I formally requested that this information be immediately deleted from the credit file TransUnion maintain under my Social Security number. I reminded TransUnion that they have 30 days to complete this investigation, as per the Fair Credit Reporting Act Section 611 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ), and I kept careful records of TransUnions actions, including TransUnions Method of Verification. I did not consent to XXXX or any means of automated verification. While TransUnion conducted their investigation, I contacted the New Jersey Federal Bankruptcy Court- XXXX via certified mail and return mail. In respond to my certified letter, the New Jersey Federal Bankruptcy- XXXX reported that they do not report or verify information with credit bureaus and credit agencies do not contact the Court to verify bankruptcy filing. In addition, I contacted XXXX XXXX XXXX, via certified mail, a third-party vendor that provide or sales public records to local, state, and federal courts to TransUnion. I requested a security freeze of the credit file they maintain under my Social Security number. XXXX XXXX XXXX placed the requested security freeze on the account bearing my Social Security number. TransUnion reported on XX/XX/XXXX that my account bearing my Social Security number was verified and information updated. Therefore, TransUnion has willing and knowingly report inaccurate, incomplete, unfair, unverifiable information on my credit file bearing my Social Security number. According to the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) Section 623 ( a ) ( 3 ) 623 [ 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ] ( a ) ( 3 ), states the duty to provide notice of dispute. If the completeness or accuracy of any information furnished by any person to any consumer reporting agency is disputed to such person by a consumer, the person may not furnish the information to any consumer reporting agency without notice that such information is disputed by the consumer. Furthermore, TransUnion has not updated my credit file bearing my Social Security number. I went to XXXX XXXX Police Department in XXXX, New Jersey to file an Identity Theft report but was denied because there was not a balance from the unauthorized inquiries, Chapter XXXX Bankruptcy, and Chapter XXXX Bankruptcy. TransUnion has violated the FCRA and I request that remove ALL unauthorized inquiries, the Chapter XXXX, and Chapter XXXX Bankruptcy as listed from the New Jersey Federal Bankruptcy- XXXX . TransUnion continues to violates my rights as a consumer and consumers nationwide by means of denying consumers the right of an accurate credit file bearing their Social Security number.","Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response","TRANSUNION INTERMEDIATE HOLDINGS, INC.","NJ","077XX","Servicemember","Consent provided","Web","7/21/2017","Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",2580962

"9/2/2017","Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","Credit reporting","Problem with a credit reporting company's investigation into an existing problem","Their investigation did not fix an error on your report","My name is : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, DOB XXXX/XXXX/XXXX Transunion file number : XXXX XXXX acct number : XXXX SS N0 XXXX I became aware of a gross error on my credit report and am shocked that after numerous attempts to correct it, little effort has been made by Transunion, who has only filed an electronic dispute, or XXXX, who admits to performing no researching before simply sending it back as verified. 

I became aware of this error through my membership with Trans Union 's Credit monitoring program, which costs XXXX per month, which notifies me of negative information on report and promises help in resolving it. I sent substantial documentation which should be enough to delete this error. As an XXXX of 33 years, I ca n't believe they are ignoring this information. I tell you that not to flout my credentials but to stress that they routinely just put in for an electronic verification when the circumstances do n't call for it. XXXX did nothing to research the accuracy of their information. Even when I produced Court Orders ( attached ), they still did not change report and did not explain why they did not change it. Because of this, I am seriously concerned about the manner in which they are investigating legitimate consumer disputes. Please review my documents which prove that this should not remain on the record. I appreciate your assistance. I am shocked that a major credit bureau did little to help a paying customer ( although that should make no difference ) and that both of these entities are getting away with ruining consumers lives. Please review the iron clad info I have in this case. I have run it by several consumer credit attorneys at XXXX as well and have been told that they agree with my assessment. Also, the amount of time derogatory info remains on a report should not vary depending on who that consumer is. The following errors occurred, which I would like corrected : ( 1 ) XXXX was reporting the status of my account as DEROGATORY. I have no late payments, according to their own report. 

( 2 ) XXXX reported that I had a DISMISSED BANKRUPTCY, and is using the closed date of the account ( I just refinanced with another company ) as the date when the 7 years will begin wherein the negative info will come off report ( report states "" Estimated month that this item will be removed : XXXX ''. ) In fact, I had a DISCHARGED Bankruptcy,  which is, as you know, far different than a DISMISSED Bankruptcy, which is indeed a derogatory status. 

Here are the FACTS and attending documents which support my claim that the information is inaccurate and being willfully misreported. Furthermore, XXXX, from Transunion, looked up the length of time a Chapter XXXX discharged Bankruptcy remains on a report, and verified that it is 7 years from the date the consumer first filed for XXXX. 

I sent XXXX 1 ) the proof of initial Ch XXXX filing date ( XXXX XXXX, XXXX ) ; 2 ) proof that my Ch XXXX bankruptcy was discharged & not dismissed ( Court Order ). Apparently, despite my best attempts, XXXX did not understand the difference between a Ch XXXX dismissed BK versus a discharged XXXX. 

Furthermore, XXXX did agree that NOTHING about the Ch XXXX should be reported seven years after the case is filed. Since my case was filed on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, any reference to a BANKRUPTCY should not be permitted. In this case, the creditor put it in the remarks section where such info is often overlooked. XXXX told me that the remarks section is only used for the creditors private use. Clearly, since it is part of the public credit report, this is inaccurate. 

Transunion asked for this info to be verified electronically several times. This is not the type of info that can be verified electronically, as it involves remarks sections, etc. XXXX came back with "" INFO REMAINS ''. There was no attempt on either XXXX or TRANSUNION 'S PART to insure that the info was properly reviewed and accurate. This caused me higher interest rates, denied loans, and emotional distress. 
I find it odd that this derogatory info only appeared when I closed the account. Prior to that it was all flawless and no reference to Bankruptcy or dismissed BK whatsoever. It only appeared when we parted ways. I can give you more FACTS and US Attorney 's names to prove that there was a great deal of bad blood. I also wish to point out that for most of this loan they were not the servicer, and were In essence, my account was disputed several times with Transunion and they allowed the inaccurate info to stay. I have, on several prior occasions, faxed them proof that ( 1 ) my Ch XXXX BK was begun on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, which should cause all references to be deleted on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. XXXX from Transunion should verify that he looked it up to verify length of time. 

I received a DECISION from Transunion dated XXXX which stated that they had concluded their report and that the DISMISSED BANKRUPTCY WAS TO STAY. It also stated it would be removed on XXXX -- XXXX years since I filed Ch XXXX two times the normal time Transunion allows is their policy and procedure manual. At this point I need your help or will be forced to file for intentional infliction of emotional distress and a bevy of counts which accompany willful misreporting of a credit report. Even Ch XXXX Bankruptcy 's, in which the debtor does not repay, only remain on report for 10 years. 

Finally, when the information was deleted on the credit report for a day or two, the scores themselves would not change. I am sending a report with no derogatory info re : XXXX but the scores show the underlying reasons and deduct the underlying points. I am asking that this manner of reporting info not on credit report be stopped.

No where on the site or statement did it say if you go any further a hard pull ( inquiry ) would be required. I later called customer service to ask before moving any further and was told I should expect that it would be a hard inquiry since it is credit related. I followed up by stating that no where did the application ask for authorization to pull my credit profile. Also, the customer representative telling me the truth in lending statement states a credit pull is necessary and then once he checks and he realizes that it does n't say a credit pull is required, then he states '' well you should have figured that out '' is an unacceptable business practice. My response to the rep is that most alternative loan sites do n't normally do hard pulls so you can not assume all consumers will understand that. It is also misleading because no where on the site does it inform the consumer that a hard inquiry is required to apply. I do not want a loan and was only researching rates and would like the credit pull removed from my Trans union profile. I should not be penalized because the site is not transparent.
